# Linear Regression for Power Law Distribution Fitting

The Python code that generated the plots in the paper [Linear Regression for Power Law Distribution Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13229) 
is found in the file errors_regression.ipynb. This paper researched into the bias that results from fitting the continous power law comparing linear 
regression to MLE.
