# power_law_fitting

Fit the power law for continuous distribution in python using methods from Clauset et al. 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/0706.1062.pdf;

Note this has been done much more extensively with in particular 
the $x_m$ parameter (cut off for power law) fitted a lot faster in the power law package https://github.com/jeffalstott/powerlaw
